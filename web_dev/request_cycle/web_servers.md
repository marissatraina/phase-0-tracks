# WEB SERVERS

1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux is open source and primarily developed as a group effort by volunteers on the internet from all over the world--anyone with enough knowledge has the opportunity to aid in developing and debugging the kernel, porting new software, writing documentation, or helping new users. As a result a community of developers was born with the goal of creating good software over making a profit.

2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is one of many virtual machines run by a single physical powerful server/computer often sold or rented by a hosting company. This virtual private server can run its own operating system and applications as well as have its own RAM, memory, and storage.

3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

If you are logged in as the root user all applications are being run with root priviledges, i.e. potential viruses have access everywhere now and pose a huge security threat. Also, you can perform anything without the system checking in so you are at a much higher risk of making a huge mistake without any security netting.
